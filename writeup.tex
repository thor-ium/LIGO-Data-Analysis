\begin{abstract} 
\noindent  
Through a combination of data science, statistical analysis, machine learning and intuition, I analyzed data collected
by LIGO. Throughout the project, I analyzed the Event Demographics of the LIGO data as a whole, the neutron star - neutron star merger GW170817, and discovered 
hidden correlations between variables within the data set. This helped me to understand the limitations of LIGO, how standard sirens, often sources of LIGO GW signals, 
are used to calculate the hubble constant, and the correlation between the Signal to Noise ratio and Luminosity Distance.

\section{Gravitational Waves and LIGO}

\indent

Gravitational waves are ripples in gravity that are caused by massive merger events, as well as supernovae. 
Such events can range from neutron star - neutron star mergers to black hole - black hole mergers. Extremely 
massive objects oribiting each other in a binary system, resulting in gravitational waves propogating out 
from the merger event. Gravitational waves are detectable based on their 'chirp' in which the steady mythodical 
waves generated by an extremely massive binary system increase in amplitutde and frequency as the objects grow 
closer together. This 'chirp' is also relational to the fraction of the total mass of the system that is converted back into energy. \\

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, is the facility that is used to detect gravitational waves.
In a similar way that we use the oscilation of electrons to measure electro-magnetic fields, LIGO measures the dimensionless strain of mass, to detect
gravitational waves. A caviat of this measurement is that the dimensionless strain is only $10^{-21}$ m, which is 
less than the size of a proton over a kilometer. As suxh, detecting dimensionless strain caused by gravitational waves is extremely sensitive to 
enviromental changes. A truck driving by, a Person walking within the facility, and even minute siesmic activity can through off the accuracy of LIGO's measurements. LIGO has accounted for
a number of these systematic erros in the design of its interferometer used to detect GWs. LIGO uses 2 4km arms equiped with mirrors and test masses to detect 
gravitational waves. Due to the extremely small change over such large distances, the longer the arms, the better chance of detecting gravitational waves, thus the mirrors 
change the effective travel distance within the interferometer from 4km to 1200km.

% Due to the high acceleration and high velocity collision of such objects, the total 
% mass of the system before the merger does not equal the final mass after the merger.
